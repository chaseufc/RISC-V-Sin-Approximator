# RISC-V-Sin-Approximator
This repository contains RISC-V assembly code for estimating the value of the sine function using approximation algorithms.

## Overview
The sin_estimation.asm file in this repository implements algorithms to estimate the value of the sine function for a given angle. The code utilizes RISC-V assembly language to perform efficient computations and approximation techniques. Also included is automatic testing to see to what degree the approximation is accurate to.

## Usage
* Ensure you have a RISC-V assembly language development environment set up.
* Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
* Open the sin_estimation.asm file in your preferred RISC-V assembly language editor.
* Modify the code as needed or use it directly in your RISC-V projects.
* Assemble and run the code using your RISC-V assembly language toolchain.

## Contribution
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the code or implementing additional features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
